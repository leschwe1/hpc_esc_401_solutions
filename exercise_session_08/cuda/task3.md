- for a fixed number of blocks, we find a strong decrease in runtime with increasing threads. We go from 0.091s for 16 down to 0.0096s for 160 in the case of 60 blocks

- for a fixed number of threads, we find a strong decrease in runtime with increasing blocks. We go from 0.091s for 60 down to 0.0097s for 600 in the case of 16 threads

- looked at in itself, the decrease in computation time seems to scale at the same rate as the increase (10x the blocks / 10x the threads = 10x faster)

- but at a second glance there seems to be a limit of efectiveness where runtime stops to decrease: this limit seems to be around 300 blocks and 80 threads. There and further on the computation increase seems to slow down, we don't go under 0.003s. 

- this limit might be the hardware saturation point

- so the best solution is somewhere in the middle between max blocks and max threads to not overutilize but efficiently use the GPU
