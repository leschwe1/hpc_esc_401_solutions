# Exercise Session 01 #
In this session, you will compile and run your first programs on Eiger. This directory contains two versions of the code that were parallelized using MPI or OpenMP.



All my answers to a 'commit' statement are found in an README.md file inside the taskX folder.
All files are found there as well per task.

Hope this is as expected from your side and ok. Otherwise let me know :)
Cheers
