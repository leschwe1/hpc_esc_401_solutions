*What are these routines supposed to do?*

- init_f: initialize the source term f(x,y) on a grid (according to the chosen problem)

- jacobi_step: perform one Jacobi iteration to go from u(k) to u(k+1)

- norm_diff: compute and check the convergence criterion which is given  (iterate over all points)
